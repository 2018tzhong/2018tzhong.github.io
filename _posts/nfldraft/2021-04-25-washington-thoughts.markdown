## Current State of the Franchise

The Washington Football Team is coming off of an improbable division title, winning the NFC East with a 7-9 record. As Ron Rivera and the rest of the front office prepare for the NFL Draft, they assuredly have several holes in mind that they would like to fill in the draft. In free agency, they lost a couple key pieces in Linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (who signed with the Texans) and Cornerback Ronald Darby (who signed with the Denver Broncos) while also adding some pieces in Cornerback William Jackson III and Wide Receiver Curtis Samuel. They've also applied the franchise tag to All-Pro Guard Brandon Scherff for the second season in a row, though insiders (including ESPN's John Keim) have reported that Washington offered a contract that would have offered top guard money annually, which Scherff declined. The fact that Brandon Scherff declined the long term contract, given his injury history, indicates one of two things:
1. he wants more money and is willing to be on himself for another year in order to get a bigger contract next year
2. he no longer wants to be in Washington (and perhaps wants to be closer to the Midwest where he grew up and went to college)

What I've heard from listening to John Keim indicates that Scherff is not really motivated largely by money, and thus I'm inclined to believe it's really the latter reason--that Scherff no longer wants to be in Washington. Thus that may be something that Washington attempts to address at some point in the draft (especially given that this year's Offensive Line crop is fairly deep). It would be wise if the front office expects Scherff to walk in 2021 to perhaps draft a guard replacement, have them develop behind Scherff for a year, before inevitably taking over once he is gone.

Some key needs left to address in addition to the need for a Guard replacement, including:
1. Quarterback:
    - This position was arguably the weakest on the team in 2020. Although Ryan Fitzpatrick was added in free agency, Washington will presumably look for a long-term solution here. Washington has also been active in attending the pro days of some of the top quarterback prospects
2. Offensive Tackle:
    - After Trent Williams was traded away last season, Washington was left with a large void on the left side. Although Cornelius Lucas filled in admirably, Washington has emphasized that this is a position in which they would still like to have a long-term solution
3. Linebacker:
    - Ron Rivera was saddened by the departure of Kevin Pierre-Louis, a player who improved significantly towards the end of last season and whom the team was hoping to bring back. Thus they would like to probably fill that void and target a quick weakside linebacker who can help in the passing game
4. Safety:
    - The Free Safety position was manned by a combination of Troy Apke and Jeremy Reaves this past season. Reaves may have a shot at seizing the starting role, but there may be some intriguing options in the draft
5. Tight End:
    - Although Logan Thomas performed very well last year, Ron Rivera has expressed interest in acquiring another tight end to pair with Thomas. They made a run at a tight end in Free Agency but it hasn't been revealed which one they pursued. They did sign Sammis Reyes, an international prospect from Chile who blew up his pro day as part of the NFL's International Pathway Player Program. They could target a move/h-back style tight end to try and stretch the field
6. Wide Receiver:
    - Washington already added Curtis Samuel and Adam Humphries to help out here, but they could look to add more depth at the position. This is a deep draft for receivers so there may be some exciting options when Washington's Day 2 picks come around
7. Running Back:
    - Although Antonio Gibson is the feature back moving forward, he missed a couple of games last year. During those two games Washington's run game suffered, so don't be surprised if they add a depth piece to go along with Gibson and J.D. McKissic later on in the draft

Here are my thoughts on who the Washington Football Team could target in the first few rounds

Given that list of team needs

1. Quarterback
    - Summary: Washington is surely out of position to grab one of the top five players (Lawrence, Wilson, Jones, Lance, Fields) if they were to stay at 19. To get one of those top flight prospects, they would likely need to trade up into the top 10. It's been reported that the front office would consider trading up into the top 10 to pick a specific quarterback they like, but it's unclear which one that is. Several media outlets (ESPN, NFL Network, Bleacher Report) have speculated that the quarterback they covet may be Trey Lance, others speculate it could be Justin Fields. I do believe it will be one of those two and not Mac Jones. If they decide not to trade up into the top 10, they have shown interest in Kyle Trask and Davis Mills, so those guys could be options on day 2.
    - Options:
        a. Justin Fields
        b. Trey Lance
        c. Mac Jones
        d. Davis Mills
        e. Kyle Trask
2. Offensive Line
    - Summary: Washington at 19 is in an intriguing position to upgrade at the Offensive Tackle position, or prepare themselves for a possible future without Brandon Scherff. 
    - Options:
        a. Christian Darrisaw
        b. Alijah Vera-Tucker
3. Linebacker
    - Summary:
    - Options:
        a. Jeremiah Owusu-Koromoah
        b. Zaven Collins
        c. Jamin Davis
        d. Pete Werner
4. Safety
    - Summary:
    - Options:
        a. Trevon Moehrig
        b. Richie Grant
        c. Jevon Holland
        d. Andre Cisco
        e. Divine Deablo
5. Tight End
    - Summary:
    - Options:
        a. Brevin Jordan
        b. Jacob Harris
6. Wide Receiver
    - Summary:

        a. Rashod Bateman
        b. Terrace Marshall Jr.
        c. Josh Palmer
