## Current State of the Franchise

Wow it's been a while! About 4 years since my last post on this page. Probably for good reason, as there hasn't been much to get excited about with regards to Washington's drafts over the past few years.

Since then, the Commanders have drafted the following premium prospects in the first round:
1. Jamin Davis
2. Jahan Dotson
3. Emmanuel Forbes
4. Jayden Daniels

Only one of those picks is still currently on the team. Unfortunately we were below average drafters during that period. Adam Peters has had his work cut out for him as he has had to work against those draft shortcomings, while also reforming the roster to match the physicality he and Dan Quinn target in their players. 

The 2024 draft was a definitive step in the right direction. The subsequent season that followed exceeded all expectations from this Washington fan, in making the NFC championship game just a year after being the second worst team in the league. Coupled with some shrewd trades in the offseason (Deebo Samuel and Laremy Tunsil), there is a huge opportunity this offseason to take another step in the progression of this team. The expectations for this team have never been higher.

So what are the holes we still have left to target? While there's no definitive hole that we have on the team, where we have 0 option on the roster going into next season, there is definitely room for upgrades all over the starting lineup next year. 

Some of the positions I could see being targeted in the draft are the following:
1. Defensive EDGE athleticism
2. Cornerback
3. Explosive running back (an upgrade for Brian Robinson)
4. X or Y type wide receiver
5. Inside Linebacker (an heir for Bobby Wagner)
6. Offensive line in general (though specifically G)
