Some of the positions I could see being targeted by Adam Peters and Lance Newmarks in the draft are the following:
1. Defensive EDGE (targeting athleticism specifically)
2. Cornerback
3. Explosive running back (an upgrade for Brian Robinson)
4. X or Y type wide receiver
5. Inside Linebacker (an heir for Bobby Wagner)
6. Offensive line in general (though specifically G)
